  I am a 21-year-old IT enthusiast with a strong passion for exploring new technologies. I completed my VCE in 2020 at Wheelers Hill Secondary School while also working on my Certificate III in Information, Digital Media, and Technology. I then went on to complete a Diploma in Digital and Interactive Games, where I gained valuable experience and skills in software and hardware development. I have also worked on several projects involving Raspberry Pis and Arduino Units, further expanding my knowledge and expertise in the field of IT. I am currently studying towards a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science (Cyber Security) and am constantly seeking opportunities to enhance my skills and knowledge.

    Based on my skills and experience, I consider myself proficient in several tools commonly used in IT and design fields. Through my work with Cisco Packet Tracer, I have developed a strong understanding of networking concepts and an ability to simulate complex network scenarios. I am skilled in using Unreal Engine 4 to develop games and create 3D visualizations, and I am extremely knowledgeable in Autodesk 3ds Max, which has allowed me to create complex 3D models and visualizations. My experience with Photoshop has given me the ability to design graphics and manipulate images effectively. In addition, my proficiency with Microsoft 365 products, including Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, has enabled me to use these tools effectively in a business or academic setting. Overall, I feel that my diverse set of skills and experience with a range of tools reflects a strong foundation in IT and design fields.
